Aim: To write a java program that import and use the user defined packages.
Description:
 In Java, user-defined packages allow you to group related classes and interfaces together, making
your code more modular, organized, and easier to manage. A package is essentially a namespace
that organizes classes and interfaces in a way that avoids naming conflicts and enhances code
maintainability.
How to Create and Use User-Defined Packages:
1. Creating a Package: To create a user-defined package, you use the package keyword at the top of
your Java source file. This defines the package name. package packagename;
2. Using the Package: To use the classes from a user-defined package, you need to import the
package in the class where you want to use it, using the import statement.
1) import pacakgename.*;// importing all classes and interfaces except sub packages
2) import packagename.classname; //importing specified class in that package
3) packagename.classname obj=new packagename.classname() //fully qualified importing
for different packeges have same classname to avoid collision.

Source code:
Package Code:
package pack1;
public class Addition {
public void add(int a, int b) {
int c = a + b;
System.out.println("The sum is " + c);
}
}
Program Code:
import pack1.Addition;
class demopack {
public static void main(String[] args) {
Addition a1 = new Addition();
a1.add(15, 27);
}
}
How to Compile:
Save these Code snippets in two Separate files named as
Addition.java & demopack.java.
Use the following commands to compile and run


9b1) Without writing any code, build a GUI that display text in label and image in an
ImageView(use JavaFX)
Aim: Without writing any code, to build a GUI that display text in label and image in an imageView
(use JavaFX)
Description: JavaFX project creation and developing sample application steps:
1. First install eclipse for java developer and
2. Next install scene Builder in your system and download javaFX SDK
3. Open Eclipse and next go to helpeclipse marketplace.It will shows following window

Execution:
1. First create one new FXML document(Test1.fxml) then right click on that select open with scene
builder and Design your Test1.fxml file like following screen.

After designing save and close the Test1.fxml file then code automatically generated by scene
builder like following:
Ctrl+P to see the output.






9c) Build a Tip Calculator app using several JavaFX components and learn how to respond to user
interactions with the GUI
1. First create one new FXML document(Test1.fxml) then right click on that select open with scene
builder and Design your tipcal.fxml file like following screen.

And give ids for some controls to using into back end.

2. Create another class for using the above scene builder controls in back-end
Mycontrol.java
package application;
//MyControl.java
import javafx.fxml.FXML;
import javafx.scene.control.*;
public class MyControl {
//linking front end id to backend for using the controls by @FXML
@FXML
private TextField priceField, tipField;
@FXML
private Button calculateButton;
@FXML
private Label resultLable;
@FXML

public void initialize() {
// Setup code, like setting initial values or event handlers
calculateButton.setOnAction(event -> tipCalculate());
}
private void tipCalculate() {
try {
double price = Double.parseDouble(priceField.getText());
double tipPercent = Double.parseDouble(tipField.getText());
if (price < 0 || tipPercent < 0) {
resultLable.setText("Please enter positive values.");
} else { double tipAmount = price * tipPercent / 100;
double totalAmount = price + tipAmount;
resultLable.setText("Tip: $" + String.format("%.2f", tipAmount) + ", Total: $" +
String.format("%.2f", totalAmount));
}
} catch (NumberFormatException ex) {
resultLable.setText("Please enter valid numbers.");
}
}
}

3. To add this MyControl.java file into tipcal.fxml by following attribute and add fx: before id
attribute of all controls:
fx:controller=” application.MyControl”
Here application is package and MyControl is class.

4.Load the tipcal.fxml into your application.
TipCalculator.java :
package application;
//TipCalculator.java
import javafx.application.Application;
import javafx.fxml.FXMLLoader;
import javafx.scene.Parent;
import javafx.scene.Scene;
import javafx.stage.Stage;

public class TipCalculator extends Application {
@Override
public void start(Stage primaryStage) throws Exception {
FXMLLoader loader = new FXMLLoader(getClass().getResource("tipcal.fxml"));
Parent root = loader.load();
primaryStage.setTitle("Tip calculator UI");
primaryStage.setScene(new Scene(root));
primaryStage.show();
}
public static void main(String[] args) {
launch(args);
}
}
5. Finally Run the application and you will get a following out:
